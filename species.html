    <div class="item"><h3>Amaranth</h3><p>Edible plant with green or red leaves and small seeds. Young leaves are eaten raw or cooked. Seeds are collected and used like grains.</p></div>
    <div class="item"><h3>Asparagus (Wild)</h3><p>Thin green shoots that grow from perennial roots. Shoots are collected in spring before they become woody. Grows near shrubs, trails, and edges of forests.</p></div>
    <div class="item"><h3>Black Chanterelle</h3><p>Dark gray to black mushroom with a funnel shape. Grows on forest floors among leaf litter, especially in deciduous woods. Appears in late summer and autumn.</p></div>
    <div class="item"><h3>Chestnut</h3><p>Brown edible nuts enclosed in spiny husks. Ripen in autumn and fall from the tree. Often collected from the ground in chestnut woodlands.</p></div>
    <div class="item"><h3>Chickweed</h3><p>Low-growing plant with oval leaves and small white flowers. Young leaves and stems are edible. Common in gardens and damp soils.</p></div>
    <div class="item"><h3>Dandelion</h3><p>Widespread plant with jagged leaves, yellow flowers, and deep roots. Leaves are used fresh or cooked. Roots are harvested in autumn.</p></div>

    <div class="item"><h3>Larch Cones</h3><p>Small cones from the larch tree. Collected for extract or syrup. Larch is the only deciduous conifer in Europe, with needle drop in autumn.</p></div>
    <div class="item"><h3>Lingonberry</h3><p>Evergreen shrub producing small red berries. Berries are tart and used in preserves. Grows in acidic soils of boreal forests.</p></div>
    <div class="item"><h3>Masterwort</h3><p>Herbaceous plant native to mountainous areas. Has toothed leaves and white or pink umbrella-like flower heads. Historically used in alpine cooking.</p></div>
    <div class="item"><h3>Morel</h3><p>Mushroom with a cone-shaped, honeycomb-textured cap. Grows in moist forests and clearings after spring rains. Hollow inside.</p></div>
    <div class="item"><h3>Porcini</h3><p>Large mushroom with thick white stalk and brown cap. Found near conifer and broadleaf trees. Cap is smooth, pores underneath instead of gills.</p></div>
