    <h1>Wild Edibles on Funges</h1>
    <p>These are the wild plants, berries, nuts and mushrooms currently featured on the map. Each has specific growing conditions, and their presence is inferred from environmental data.</p>

    <div class="item"><h3>Amaranth (<em>Amaranthus retroflexus</em>)</h3>
      <p>A highly versatile plant with vibrant green or red leaves and tiny protein-rich seeds. The young leaves can be used like spinach, while the seeds are a traditional grain substitute packed with nutrients. Foragers prize it for its dual use — leafy greens and pseudo-cereal — often thriving in disturbed soils and open sunny areas.</p>
      <p><strong>🔪 How To:</strong> Cook the young leaves as you would spinach. Rinse thoroughly to remove grit. The seeds can be lightly toasted and used like quinoa or in porridge.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="item"><h3>Asparagus (<em>Asparagus acutifolius</em>)</h3>
      <p>Slender green spears pushing through the soil in early spring mark the arrival of wild asparagus. Unlike its cultivated cousin, it grows among shrubs and hedges, especially near trails. Its tender shoots offer a concentrated flavor and are one of the earliest foraged vegetables of the year.</p>
      <p><strong>🔪 How To:</strong> Snap off young spears and steam, sauté, or grill them. Avoid tough, woody stems.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="item"><h3>Black Chanterelle (<em>Craterellus cornucopioides</em>)</h3>
      <p>Nicknamed “horn of plenty,” this elusive mushroom has a smoky black hue and trumpet shape. It thrives in damp leaf litter under beech and oak trees. With a rich aroma and excellent shelf life when dried, it's a prized ingredient in broths and sauces.</p>
      <p><strong>🔪 How To:</strong> Clean gently and cook thoroughly. Best sautéed or dried for long-term storage. Pairs well with pasta and risotto.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="item"><h3>Chestnut (<em>Castanea sativa</em>)</h3>
      <p>Sweet, starchy nuts encased in spiky husks, dropping from towering chestnut trees in autumn. They’ve been a staple in mountain diets for centuries — eaten roasted, milled into flour, or boiled.</p>
      <p><strong>🔪 How To:</strong> Always cook before eating. Roast over an open flame, bake, or boil. Score the shell first to prevent bursting.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="item"><h3>Chickweed (<em>Stellaria media</em>)</h3>
      <p>A delicate green carpet of edible leaves and starry white flowers. Chickweed grows almost year-round in moist soil. Its mild flavor makes it a go-to wild salad green.</p>
      <p><strong>🔪 How To:</strong> Eat raw in salads or lightly wilt in soups. Wash well to remove dirt.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="item"><h3>Dandelion (<em>Taraxacum officinale</em>)</h3>
      <p>One of the most widespread and versatile wild plants. Every part — leaf, flower, and root — is edible and medicinal.</p>
      <p><strong>🔪 How To:</strong> Young leaves for salads, older ones cooked to reduce bitterness. Flowers for syrups or fritters. Roast roots for tea or coffee substitute.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="item"><h3>Garlic (<em>Allium ursinum</em>)</h3>
      <p>Aromatic green leaves and white blossoms carpeting forest floors in spring. Also known as ramsons, this plant emits a strong garlic scent.</p>
      <p><strong>🔪 How To:</strong> Use fresh leaves in pestos, oils, or omelets. Flowers are edible too. Do not confuse with toxic lookalikes (e.g., lily of the valley).</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="item"><h3>Lingonberry (<em>Vaccinium vitis-idaea</em>)</h3>
      <p>Tiny ruby-red berries growing low in boreal forests and alpine heaths. Tart and high in antioxidants.</p>
      <p><strong>🔪 How To:</strong> Best cooked into jam or sauce. Too sour to eat raw in quantity. Often used with meat dishes.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="item"><h3>Masterwort (<em>Peucedanum ostruthium</em>)</h3>
      <p>Aromatic perennial from mountainous regions, used historically as food and medicine.</p>
      <p><strong>🔪 How To:</strong> Leaves can be infused into liqueurs or herbal teas. Use sparingly due to strong flavor.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="item"><h3>Morel (<em>Morchella esculenta</em>)</h3>
      <p>Highly sought-after mushroom with honeycomb cap. Appears in spring after rain.</p>
      <p><strong>🔪 How To:</strong> Always cook — never eat raw. Slice and sauté in butter or cream sauces. Excellent with meat and pasta.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="item"><h3>Porcino (<em>Boletus edulis</em>)</h3>
      <p>Also called “king bolete,” this robust mushroom grows under conifers and oaks. Rich in umami.</p>
      <p><strong>🔪 How To:</strong> Clean and slice before sautéing. Can be dried and rehydrated for sauces and stews. Avoid bitter or spongy specimens.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="item"><h3>Nettle (<em>Urtica dioica</em>)</h3>
      <p>Known for its sting, but rich in iron and vitamins. Grows near streams and barns.</p>
      <p><strong>🔪 How To:</strong> Always cook or dry to remove sting. Ideal for soups, pesto, or tea. Wear gloves when harvesting.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="item"><h3>Parasol Mushroom (<em>Macrolepiota procera</em>)</h3>
      <p>Tall mushroom with snakeskin-patterned stem and scaly cap. Found in grasslands and forest edges.</p>
      <p><strong>🔪 How To:</strong> Slice and pan-fry like schnitzel. Remove tough stem. Cook thoroughly.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="item"><h3>Raspberry (<em>Rubus idaeus</em>)</h3>
      <p>Sweet red fruits on thorny canes in summer. Grows along forest margins and hedgerows.</p>
      <p><strong>🔪 How To:</strong> Eat fresh or use in desserts, jams, or teas (leaves). Wash before use.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="item"><h3>Sorrel (<em>Rumex acetosa</em>)</h3>
      <p>Arrow-shaped leaves with lemony taste due to oxalates. Found in meadows and pastures.</p>
      <p><strong>🔪 How To:</strong> Use raw in salads or cooked into soups and sauces. Avoid large amounts if prone to kidney stones.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="item"><h3>Strawberry (<em>Fragaria vesca</em>)</h3>
      <p>Small, aromatic berries found in forest clearings. More flavorful than cultivated varieties.</p>
      <p><strong>🔪 How To:</strong> Eat raw, add to desserts, or dry for tea. Leaves can also be brewed into herbal tea.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="item"><h3>Black Truffle (<em>Tuber melanosporum</em>)</h3>
      <p>Subterranean fungus found in Mediterranean oak and hazel groves. Collected with dogs or pigs.</p>
      <p><strong>🔪 How To:</strong> Shave raw over warm dishes like pasta, eggs, or risotto. Use sparingly for strong flavor impact.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="item"><h3>Walnut (<em>Juglans regia</em>)</h3>
      <p>Tree producing thick-husked nuts in autumn. Found in valleys and old estates.</p>
      <p><strong>🔪 How To:</strong> Crack open and use raw or toasted in baking, sauces, or as a snack. Husk may stain hands.</p>
