      <h1>Terms of Use</h1>
      <p>
        Welcome to the service (referred to as "the Service"). By accessing or
        using the Service, you agree to comply with these Terms of Service
        ("Terms"). If you do not agree, please discontinue use of the Service.
      </p>

      <h2>Important Safety Warning</h2>
      <p>
        This Service uses a machine learning model for mushroom identification,
        but it is not 100% reliable. Many mushrooms look similar, and
        misidentification can result in severe poisoning or death. Do not rely
        on this Service to determine if a mushroom is safe to eat. Always
        consult a professional mycologist or a local expert before consuming or
        handling wild mushrooms.
      </p>

      <h2>Use of the Service</h2>
      <p>
        The Service provides information about wild edibles conditions based on
        various factors. The information is for general guidance only and is not
        guaranteed to be accurate, complete, or up-to-date.
      </p>

      <h2>Foraging Disclaimer</h2>
      <p>
        The Service includes recipes and information about wild edible plants,
        berries, nuts, and mushrooms. While every effort is made to ensure
        accuracy, the safe consumption of wild edibles depends entirely on
        correct identification, appropriate preparation, and individual health
        conditions.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong
          >Misidentification of wild plants or fungi can lead to allergic
          reactions, poisoning, or other serious health consequences.</strong
        >
        Some edible species have toxic lookalikes. Always consult a local expert
        or use an authoritative guide when identifying wild edibles, and do not
        consume anything unless you are 100% certain of its safety.
      </p>
      <p>
        Additionally, some wild edibles should only be consumed in small
        quantities or after specific preparation methods to neutralize naturally
        occurring compounds. Recipes provided by the Service are for educational
        purposes and assume correct identification and proper handling of
        ingredients.
      </p>

      <h2>Disclaimer of Liability</h2>
      <p>
        You use the Service at your own risk. The administrator assumes no
        responsibility for accidents, injuries, damages, or other incidents
        resulting from reliance on the Service's information. Conditions in
        natural environments may change unexpectedly, and you are responsible
        for exercising caution and judgment when planning or undertaking
        activities based on information provided by the Service.
      </p>
      <p>
        A variety of fungi and fruits grow in the wild, and some may be toxic or
        harmful if misidentified. The predictions provided by this Service are
        generated by a machine learning model and should be considered only as
        an advisory tool. This model is not perfect and may produce incorrect
        classifications. Misidentifying mushrooms can lead to severe poisoning
        or death. Always consult a qualified expert before consuming or handling
        any fungi or fruits.
      </p>

      <h2>No Professional Advice</h2>
      <p>
        The information provided by the Service is not intended to substitute
        professional advice, including but not limited to safety, health, or
        environmental guidance. Always consult local authorities or experts
        before undertaking outdoor activities.
      </p>

      <h2>Third-Party Content and Services</h2>
      <p>
        The Service may display advertisements or integrate third-party
        services. The administrator is not responsible for the content,
        accuracy, or practices of any third-party services. Your interaction
        with such services is governed by their respective terms and policies.

        including text, graphics, and other materials, are the property of the
        administrator unless otherwise stated. You may not reproduce,
        distribute, or modify any part of the Service without prior written
        permission.

      <h2>Prohibited Use</h2>
      <p>You agree not to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Use the Service in any unlawful manner.</li>

          Service.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Changes to the Terms</h2>
      <p>
        The administrator reserves the right to modify these Terms at any time.
        Any changes will be effective immediately upon posting to the Service.
        Continued use of the Service constitutes acceptance of the updated
        Terms.
      </p>

      <h2>Governing Law</h2>
      <p>
        These Terms are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of
        Switzerland. Any disputes arising from or related to the use of the
        Service will be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of
